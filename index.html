        This orchid is called the Blue Vanda because of its large, blue flowers,
        which amazed people when it was first brought to Europe in 1847. Because
        of its beauty, many expeditions were made to collect the orchid, putting
        it in danger. Today, scientists are studying the orchid’s medicinal
        properties. In India, the flowers have been used to help treat chest
        problems, and the leaf juice has been used for treating diarrhea,
        dysentery, and skin issues. The Blue Vanda has an upright flower stem
        that can grow up to 2 feet long and can have several long-lasting white
        flowers with a blue crosshatch pattern. Each flower is about 4 inches
        wide and has a lovely fragrance. It blooms from August to December in
        the Northern Hemisphere, with the peak blooming season in November.
        Sadly, the Blue Vanda is still at risk due to habitat loss and the
        effects of over-collection in the past. Protecting this orchid and its
        natural environment is vital to keep it thriving for future generations
        to appreciate.

        This orchid, named after a Dutch plant collector, is known for its
        bright and beautiful flowers. Its tall stem can grow 26–44 inches long
        and usually has 3–5 orange and yellow flowers that bloom one at a time.
        Each flower is about 3 inches wide and looks like a butterfly, which is
        why it’s called a "Butterfly Orchid." These orchids grow on trees in
        tropical rainforests in South America. They don’t harm the trees—they
        just use them for support. Sadly, because of habitat loss and
        over-collection, these amazing orchids are at risk. Protecting them and
        their natural habitats is important to ensure that future generations
        can continue to enjoy their beauty. Their colorful, butterfly-like
        flowers make them popular with people who love orchids, and efforts to
        conserve them help keep these unique plants alive.

      </div>
      <p>
        The Phragmipedium × richteri 'Wolf River' is a type of orchid known for
        its unique, pouch-like flowers. This orchid grows on the ground and is
        part of the Orchidaceae family, which includes many beautiful and
        interesting plants. The 'Wolf River' variety is cultivated, meaning it’s
        grown in controlled conditions and not found in the wild. It’s currently
        displayed at the Smithsonian Gardens' National Portrait Gallery. Even
        though it’s not wild, it's important to protect all types of orchids and
        their habitats because many species face threats from habitat loss and
        over-collection. Conservation efforts help keep these amazing plants
        safe for the future.
